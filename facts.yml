- Capybara are the largest rodents in the world. That's a big rodent!
- The capybara is found in Panama, Colombia, Venezuela, the Guyanas and Peru, south through Brazil, Paraguay, northeast Argentina, and Uruguay.
- Capybara shake when they come out of the water. 
- During mating, the female has the advantage and mating choice. Sque-ek!
- Capybaras are semi-aquatic and live in densely forested areas near bodies of water, such as lakes, rivers, swamps, ponds and marshes, as well as flooded savannah and along rivers in tropical forest.
- The capybara is a grazing herbivore, eating mainly grasses and aquatic plants.
- Capybaras are so trainable that in Surinam a blind man once used a capybara as a guide animal.
- Capybaras have slightly webbed feet and vestigial tails. Wiggle wiggle.
- Capybara are highly social and live in groups controlled by a dominant male.
- The bigger the morrillo (the scent gland on the capy's nose), the more dominant the male.
- The capybara's thin, coarse hair gives protection from scratches without causing the animal to get too hot.
- The scientific name, both hydrochoerus and hydrochaeris, comes from Greek hydor (water) + choiros (pig, hog).
- Capybara populations are considered stable through much of their range, but hunting in some areas has reduced their numbers. Uh-oh!
- Capybara dive and may remain underwater for as long as five minutes.
- The capybara is the largest of all living rodents.
- As many as 100 capys can be found living in groups at any one time; the group is controlled by a single dominant male. Lucky rodent!
- In the language of the Guarani Indians, capybara means “master of the grasses.”
- Capybaras not supplemented with vitamin C in captivity have been reported to develop gum disease as a sign of scurvy. Arrrr!
- If they sense danger, they will dive into the water and hide, and they can stay underwater for five minutes. 
- If necessary they can even sleep underwater with only their noses poking out. ~~~~>O<~~~~~
- Capybara gestation is 130–150 days.
- Capybaras communicate with a variety of sounds including soft whimpers, clicking noises, purring and barking.
- A capy can lift just those parts out of the water to learn everything it needs to know about its surroundings, while the rest of its body remains hidden underwater. Smart, huh?
- All females within the group help care for and nurse the young.
- Capybaras are gentle and will usually allow humans to pet and hand-feed them. Fuzzy love for everyone!
- Adult capybara can eat 6 to 8 pounds (2.7 to 3.6 kilograms) of grass per day!
- In the 16th century, the Catholic Church classified the capybara, which can swim, as a fish so that the meat could be eaten on Fridays and during Lent.
- If one animal feels threatened, the whole group will bark until danger has passed. Squeek squeek!
- Males often walk right over bushes in order to mark them and can leave behind hairs that are crusted with oily, smelly secretions.
- Baby capybaras can eat grass within the first week of life, so their moms can get back to work quickly!
- The capybara reaches sexual maturity at around 12 to 18 months.
- The biggest capybara ever recorded tipped the scales at 232 lbs. Woah!
- Capybaras sleep very little, often grazing most of the day, taking a quick nap here and there, and then grazing all night.
- The dominant male will keep his position by chasing the subordinate males, but males rarely fight.
- Adult capybaras may be as long as 4.5 ft long 1.6 ft tall, and weigh more than 100 pounds. Plenty of rodent-y love!
- Capybaras often check how soft the ground in front of them is before walking on it.
- Capybara fur does not smell because they do not have a thick undercoat.
- Capybaras can close their noses and ears. Good for going underwater!
